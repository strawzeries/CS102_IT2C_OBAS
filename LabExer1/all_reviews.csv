"23","Lipstick","Maybelline Super Stay Vinyl Ink Longwear Liquid Lipcolor, Captivated, 4.1 ml","DZ","Ho acquistato il colore 30 - UNRIVALED e sono rimasta molto soddisfatta. Riassumo per punti le informazioni salienti:PACKAGING: molto carino, dello stesso colore del rossetto all'interno. Cosa fondamentale: arriva con etichetta-sigillo quindi si √® sicure che non √® stato aperto e usato da altri.ASPETTO: profumazione dolce ma non fastidiosa, √® la stessa dei matte ink. Il colore √® un rosso amarena che mette molto in risalto il bianco dei denti.APPLICAZIONE: pi√π il rossetto √® scuro meno √® facile, ma si riesce comunque ad applicare bene se si ha un po' di pazienza. Quando non voglio avere un effetto troppo scuro picchietto poco prodotto con le dita per un effetto tinta labbra leggero. In questo modo si riesce ad avere un prodotto che permette due utilizzi diversi, uno adatto per il giorno, l'altro per la sera o per occasioni importanti.TENUTA: √® molto simile a quella dei superstay matte ink (quindi molto lunga) con una resa pi√π cremosa, che fa sembrare le labbra pi√π idratate.RIMOZIONE: per tutti i trucchi di questo tipo io utilizzo direttamente l'olio di mandorle. Anche con quello la rimozione non √® facilissima, ma √® una ulteriore conferma che questo rossetto √® a lunghissima tenuta.","Reviewed in Italy on 28 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Questo √® il motivo per cui ha deciso di provare questo rossetto di L'Or√©al e anche perch√© sono stata molto attratta dalla confezione molto curata, che ricorda rossetti di marchi molto pi√π prestigiosi e costosiIL TESTSicuramente un punto a favore per questo rossetto √® l'elegante confezione: plastica rigida e spessa con scanalature che rendono la superficie ""diamantata"" e una banda centrale dorata con sopra impresso il logo aziendale. Appena si stende sulle labbra, questo rossetto dona una forte sensazione di idratazione e anche il colore √® molto bello, tenuo ma visibile, anche grazie all'effetto gloss.  Purtroppo per√≤ il colore non dura pi√π di un paio d'ore e, se si osa bere anche solo un caff√®, sparisce del tutto. Io ho risolto questo problema portando questo rossetto ovunque con me, tanto l'applicazione √® talmente facile che pu√≤ essere fatta ovunque e in qualsiasi momento e la sensazione di idratazione che d√† √® davvero irrinunciabile.CONCLUDENDOSe desiderate un rossetto che duri almeno per una mattinata intera questo prodotto no fa per voi, ma se le caratteristiche positive descritte prima (estrema morbidezza del prodotto e ottima idratazione delle labbra) sono cose che vi attraggono, vi consiglio di provare questo prodotto, anche perch√© il prezzo non √® eccessivo (circa 8 euro al momento della recensione).Sperando di esservi stata d'aiuto per una scelta ponderata, vi auguro buon acquisto ;-)AI VOTI8/10","Reviewed in Spain on 27 April 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

But the color lingers pretty well, so I just add clear gloss or lip balm to my lips when they've become too dry & there's still enough color left. The darker pink is a bit too intense, kinda too Barbie Doll pink, so I apply it very lightly &/or just add a very light coat of the orange to change up the intenseness of it. The light pink is almost too un-intense, if that makes sense. (A happy medium between the 2 pinks would've appealed more to me). The orange is pretty intense also, so I apply that very lightly or add some of the light pink to it to make it not SO orange. But everyone is different, so you just have to play around/experiment with the colors, which is kinda fun. So while not perfect, I'm giving the trio 4 stars instead of 5. I enjoy the challenge.When all's said & done, I'd say, ""go ahead & give it a try"". It is returnable, so you don't have much to lose.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 September 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Insgesamt finde ich sie klasse besonders I CHOOSE hat mich √ºberrascht, trotz des stark pinken Untertons. Ich wollte hier paar Punkte zum Produkt hierlassen:Zum einem will ich anmerken, dass das hier kein Liquid Lipstick ist wie die meisten ihn kennen, sondern ein LIPSTAIN. Hei√üt im Grunde nur das er nicht auf Wax- oder √ñlbasis ist, sondern auf Wasserbasis. Die Konsequenz daraus ist, dass der Lipstain sehr w√§ssrig ist und h√§ufig dadurch fleckig aufgetragen wird, weil man mit den Applikatoren das Produkt auf den Lippen abtr√§gt. Aber wie bei anderen derartigen Produkten sollte man immer mindestens zwei Schichten auftragen damit alles gleichm√§√üig aussieht. Also: erste Schicht. trocknen lassen. dann die zweite. Ansonsten schiebt man sich das Produkt nur auf den Lippen rum, da die w√§ssrige Konsistenz erst ""einziehen"" muss.Was mich zum n√§chsten Punkt bringt das Trocknen. Das dauert leider recht lange und k√∂nnte der Grund sein weshalb einige sagen, dass der nicht lange h√§lt. Wenn er aber einmal runter getrocknet ist, sitzt er bombenfest auch nach dem Essen. Vielleicht nicht nach einem sehr √∂lhaltigem aber f√ºr den Preis finde ich die Haltbarkeit super!Zusammengefasst:  + Farbe, Haltbarkeit, Ergebnis, keine trockenen Lippen, setzt sich nicht ab und creased nicht (da Lipstain) - Preisleistung, braucht etwas bis es runter trocknet.Insgesamt einfach toll!","Reviewed in Italy on 31 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

It's so rich & creamy- even if my lips aren't 100% smooth it seems to blur any imperfections, and it doesn't make my lips feel dry at all.As a brunette with olive tone skin, it can be hard to find a nude shade that doesn't completeley ""wash out"" my lips, but this shade is very flattering, especially when paired with a bold eye and no other makeup! I also love that I could put it on without a mirror if need be (not something you can do with red shades!)It isn't exactly long-lasting as the title suggests, I had to re-apply about 3 times in the day, but I didn't mind because the packaging is so cute, I love it!!","Reviewed in the United States on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
