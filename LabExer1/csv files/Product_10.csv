"9","Lipstick","Rimmel London Lasting Finish Lipstick by Kate Nude 42 Apricot Nude","V","I've purchased a couple of these lipsticks and find they are very moist on the lips and love the neutral shades. They don't stay on for long so do require touchups during the day, however they do come off clean so no horrible stain left on your lips which I prefer.","Reviewed in Australia on 12 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"17","Lipstick","Rimmel London Lasting Finish Lipstick by Kate Nude 42 Apricot Nude","charlie","Tolle Farbabgabe. Cremig und angenehm zu tragen. Sehr gut beim Auftragen. Haltbarkeit wie jeder normale Lippenstift. Lipliner ab Ü40 ist notwendig. Angenehmer Geruch. Mein absoluter Liebling unter meinen vielen Lippenstiften. Jederzeit zu empfehlen. Vor allen auch bei jungen Mädels. Keine Farbe die aufdringlich wirkt. 5 von 5 Krönchen.","Reviewed in France on 15 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"19","Lipstick","Rimmel London Lasting Finish Lipstick by Kate Nude 42 Apricot Nude","Hendrika Stoelwinder","Me gustaria saber si su fabricacion es reciente o son stock de hace bastantes años puesto que los retiraron del mercado al menos en España.

"20","Lipstick","Rimmel London Lasting Finish Lipstick by Kate Nude 42 Apricot Nude","Katrin Pron","I bought this on a whim- considering the 100+ lipsticks I own, it wasn't exactly a ""necessity"" lol- but now it is!! It's so rich & creamy- even if my lips aren't 100% smooth it seems to blur any imperfections, and it doesn't make my lips feel dry at all.As a brunette with olive tone skin, it can be hard to find a nude shade that doesn't completeley ""wash out"" my lips, but this shade is very flattering, especially when paired with a bold eye and no other makeup! I also love that I could put it on without a mirror if need be (not something you can do with red shades!)It isn't exactly long-lasting as the title suggests, I had to re-apply about 3 times in the day, but I didn't mind because the packaging is so cute, I love it!!","Reviewed in the United States on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Questo è un rossetto tarocco!!!!!!!! Non ha niente a che vedere con Rimmel London!!! Non ha nemmeno la scritta “Kate” che dovrebbe avere  è una plastica talmente di bassa qualità che si spacca se la guardi sembra rossetto dei cinesi!!
