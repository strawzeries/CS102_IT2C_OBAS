"4","Lipstick","NYX Professional Makeup Powder Puff Lippie - Squad Goals","Andrea S","The colour didn't match the picture at all. It is hot pink, yuck. But worst of all the lipstick doesn't stay on properly, cakes around lines and makes my lips look stained. Comes off super easily. No idea why this has so many good reviews.","Reviewed in Australia on 22 January 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"5","Lipstick","NYX Professional Makeup Powder Puff Lippie - Squad Goals","こだわり消費さん","マット感を演出したい時には、うってつけの商品だと思います！とにかくマット！重ねれば重ねるほど色味が重なり濃くなっていきます。好きな濃さを調整できるタイプです。ポンポンと優しく唇に塗布するだけで、薄づきマット唇が出来上がります！！","Reviewed in Japan on 22 February 2021","1.0 out of 5 stars"
"6","Lipstick","NYX Professional Makeup Powder Puff Lippie - Squad Goals","Esiah","Es mi marca y artículo para labios favorito.Me encanta su textura. Es mate pero hidratante, no reseca, parece que no llevas nada en los labios y tienen muchos colores. A mí me encanta el nude y el número 1 color marrón que en mis labios se ve súper natural, también. Los uso a diario. Durán un montón y no se manchan o rompen por el formato en el que vienen. Tampoco es necesario perfilador. Y de precio están más baratos en Amazon que en la propia página de NYX.","Reviewed in Spain on 31 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars"

"9","Lipstick","NYX Professional Makeup Powder Puff Lippie - Squad Goals","R","Different to most lipsticks I have tried. Has a soft brush like tip which you dab on your lips to get the colour,leaves a gorgeous powdery nude colour. I would not say it is particularly long lasting but lasts longer than the standard glossy lipsticks.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
