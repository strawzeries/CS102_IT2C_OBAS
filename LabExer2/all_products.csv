"1","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Tint Lipstick 9.5 g, 02 Cherry Ade","Doesn't last very long but still exactly what I wanted!","Carly Sheen","I could never find the kind of gentle lip tint I was looking for. This is perfect. I like the ""I just ate a red popsicle"" look- like a gentle red tint that fades out to the edge of my lips. This needs to be re applied very often, like every 1.5 hrs minimum. But it's such an easy and gentle stain that's not a big deal. My favorite thing to use on my lips!!!","Reviewed in Canada on 12 January 2023","4.1 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"3","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Tint Lipstick 9.5 g, 02 Cherry Ade","incredible","b","I wear this pretty much every day, it's the single best lip product I've ever used. Absolutely no residue, it feels like there's nothing on your lips. The colour is gorgeous and it builds the more you apply, and it smells good. It's fairly long lasting if you apply a lot, I usually have to reapply a couple times when I go out. Overall, this is an incredible product, highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

As a fan of K-beauty products, I was excited to try this lip tint, and it certainly did not disappoint.One of the standout features of this water tint is its vivid color payoff. The Cherry Ade shade adds a vibrant pop of red to my lips, instantly brightening up my complexion and adding a touch of playfulness to my look. The color is buildable, allowing me to achieve my desired intensity with ease.What sets this water tint apart is its moisturizing formula. Unlike some lip stains that can leave my lips feeling dry and parched, the Dear Darling Water Tint keeps my lips hydrated throughout the day.

Once applied, it stays put for hours without fading or feathering, allowing me to go about my day with confidence. Whether I'm sipping on coffee or enjoying a meal, I can trust that my lip color will remain intact.Another aspect that I love about this product is its versatility. In addition to being used as a lip tint, I've found that it can also double as a cheek stain, adding a natural flush of color to my complexion for a fresh and youthful look.In summary, the ETUDE Dear Darling Water Tint in Cherry Ade (21AD) is a must-have for anyone looking for a vibrant and moisturizing lip stain. Its smudge-proof and lightweight formula, coupled with its vivid color payoff, make it a standout choice in the world of K-beauty.

"12","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Tint Lipstick 9.5 g, 02 Cherry Ade","Perfect for lasting tint","GKB","I freaking LOVE this product. Its very runny, almost like dyed water, but that makes it no less effective. You don't need to leave it on long for a subtle hint of colour. If you want to go darker, just reapply until you have the desired shade! It also lasts so long. I won't say it stays exactly how you applied it all day, it will gradually fade and may need a top up or two throughout the day. But personally even after a long day AND washing my face, there's still a lovely subtle hint of colour that makes me look more glowy and less pasty. It's also fantastic to use under red lipstick to maintain the colour.This could also double as a blush, however you have to be quick with the application. I've found a little drop on a sponge helps disperse the product, giving a gentle glow. But don't go OTT, or you'll get clown cheeks that are hard to clean up!To sum up, an all round fantastic product that's awesome for the price. Couldn't live without!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"17","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Tint Lipstick 9.5 g, 02 Cherry Ade","Bon dupe Benefit","Ashley","Vu certains commentaires je m’attendais à pire !Fais son job très bien sur les joues, un peu moins sur les lèvres (part facilement après un repas, mais à essayer sur lèvres exfoliées, sans produits)Le produit est dosable, donc si vous voulez un résultat plus voyant vous pouvez réappliquer. Pour les résultats naturels, faites attention, c’est quand même assez concentré (1-3 points pour les joues, 1 passage pour les lèvres donne un résultat naturel sur peau claires à très claires)Le produit n’irrite pas, ne brûle pas, ne donne pas de boutons (et pourtant j’ai la peau qui réagit facilement).Le produit n’assèche pas la peau non plus.Une fois le produit appliqué et estompé avec les doigts, un peu d’eau et de savon et ça part tout de suite!L’applicateur est un applicateur en mousse, comme pour les gloss, donc très pratique à appliquer sur les joues et lèvres. (Contrairement au packaging Benefit qui donne un pinceau)Dès fois j’en met sur les yeux pour un peu de couleur.Globalement, je suis très satisfaite du produit, qui fait se qu’il est destiné à faire.Ne payez plus 25€ pour un produit qui peut vous coûter bien moins et faire le job tout aussi bien !","Reviewed in France on 3 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Does not blend at all and you have to work really really really fast. And even then it leaves very patchy marks if used on cheeks. Not cute. The only way to use it maybe MAYBE to use it as a lip tint and even then it doesn’t last that long. On cheeks it literally gives clown look because it’s almost impossible to blend.

Since I’ve discovered the Juicy Tints I’ve invested in many colours. There is a huge variety,much more than other cosmetics brands.And the colours are divine and to die for.Literally for every skin tone and every personal choice.There’s the ‘ mlbb’ colours for those of us who want our lips as natural as possible but only more beautiful and slightly blushed and the darker shades to add more intensity and stand out.Now I’m in my 50s and have pretty much given up my beloved red lipstick as I find it bleeds into the new fine lines around my lips and looks to harsh (although I did buy the Cherry Bomb and deep sangria,I just couldn’t help myself!).I tend to stick to the more natural and almost naked shades like Bare grape and Nucademia,Bare fig, Figfig etc.But of them all Mulled peach is the one that really makes me glow.It’s just a beautiful shade and one that will suit most skin tones.Naturally toned and a soft delicate shade with a glowing peachy pop of colour that automatically brightens your pallor and makes your skin ethereal and healthy looking.If you haven’t tried this one please give it a go,it’s so flattering.A bit like a peachy rose!.I’m trying not to check out any more colours as I’ve got more than enough and I always end up buying another one.If you like Mulled Peach,you will probably love Almond Rose too It’s gorgeous , go on take a peek!.Might as well treat yourself to one!.

Maybe it just didn't work on my lips and I expected too much, but I wasn't too impressed.It definitely stains your lips so if you apply one coat, leave it on for a bit and press a tissue over it to remove the tint then reapply another coat, the dark red/pink colour will stay on even after the surface colour is being wiped off.If you are looking for a tint with strong/unique colour then this does the job, but if you are after some sheer juicy buildable result like the sample photo then this isn't.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It also looks stunning and is perfect to create that signature Korean lip ombre look, or just put a straight tone over your lips. It's a little more pigmented than a tint, but definitely is still transluscent. It's kind of moisturizing, but my lips still feel a little dry once it has completely worn off. It does take quite a while to wear off, too! And even when it fades, it holds the dewy feel for longer and a slight tint of color stays longest of all except if you drink or eat.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Sadly the tint doesn't last long on my lips for some reason :/ like on my hand and cheeks it lasts long but not on my lips. Maybe I lick them too much or they're too moisturized lol2.

"302","Romand Dewyful Water Lip Tint 5 g, No.12 Canyon","Very pigmented and lightweight!","Abby Gladden","I purchased this in the custard mauve shade and I am in love!!!  It feels very watery when applied and has a softly whipped texture.  It has a more satin finish, but it doesn't feel drying or heavy.  The scent is lightly fruity and isn't overpowering.  This shade is not too dark, which is something I encounter with some mauves.  It does stain the lips slightly and has a pretty decent wear time.  I would definitely say it can last through a meal or two!  This shade is gorgeous when blended over the natural lip line. I am eager to try more shades and see if they live up to the expectations that this one sets!","Reviewed in the United States on 13 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This applicator leaks a lot when i close the tube, and it doesn’t smell as good as bare grape. It’s a little bit of a warmer pink than bare grape but finish is glossy like bare grape as long as you don’t smack your lips.Overall if you’re looking for a romand lippie, get bare grape instead. That one doesn’t leak and smells like strawberries.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"326","Romand Dewyful Water Lip Tint 5 g, No.12 Canyon","Long-lasting tint, sheer yet pigmented and very buildable, not super moisturizing","K","I love this gloss. It's pretty long-lasting - the glossiness wears off pretty quickly (I add shine by using the Romand lip water gloss over top - it's really amazing). I'd say the tint lasts about 3 hours.One swipe is actually quite pigmented. If you want it more sheer, you can add a few dollops and rub it in with your finger. If you want it more pigmented, it's definitely really buildable!If I want the color to be pigmented, I like to dab my lips with tissues after applying to leave the tint, then layer another layer on top and repeat. This add pigment to the stain, rather than just the product.I wouldn't say it's super moisturizing, but since there is absolutely no transfer after dabbing your lips, I can easily add lip balm without ruining my lip balm.I have pretty fair and cool-ish skin and I found the Salty Peach shade to be too peachy for me. Canyon is absolutely perfect - it's a light brick color which is a bit darker than my natural lip color. This makes the perfect color (for me) to wear a red lip without committing to a red lip. In my opinion, Canyon is really great for both warmer and cooler months.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I thought maybe they were more natural as the advertising talks about fruit and nutrients but there’s pretty much none of that in it.If you don’t care about chemicals, this is a stain for you. It works well. It’s also build able. Not dark enough? Apply another later. I got Dracula red and it is quite dark for me as I have an actual natural lip stain from 100%pure that is more dark pinkish dark berry color.  I wanted something that goes better with dark red clothes but couldn’t find anything truly natural. Might try making my own someday.

Starting with the color, Dracula Red, it's absolutely perfect. It could probably work well as stage blood! It smells phenomenal, but not overpowering. Most importantly it lasts on the lips. I applied it, let it dry down, then blotted. I put a similar colored gloss on top after blotting. The stain was still there even after the gloss wore away. In fact, it lasted for hours.

"406","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Gel Lip Tint Lipstick","Worth it","Maya","I really want a stain that STAINS and stays on my lips without much maintenance. This was prob one of the better/best lip ones I've used. It's better and longer lasting than many high end products (looking at you fenty poutcicle), and more saturated than I was expecting.I got the shade Dracula Red and it went on as a bold fuchsia/red that faded to a nice deep rose over time. Not too much for everyday wear in my opinion. The consistency is really light and watery, and dries down to feel like almost nothing. Gloss/balm over top doesn't take it off, and it lasted through eating and drinking.My only complaint is it does fade over the day and look a little spotty (my center lip fades faster than the edges), but it fades nicely and reapplies easily. I'd like more color variety as looks like most are similar pink/red shades and I'd love a brighter orange, coral, hot pink. I will prob get another though - for the price it can't be beat!","Reviewed in the United States on 12 October 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"415","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Gel Lip Tint Lipstick","Uneven stain","An Ak","Great color and very long lasting, however it applies very splotchy for me. Whenever I use it, it looks terrible on my lips after 10 minutes because it divides along my lip lines. Also bleeds into my teeth when first applying, but I would not mind if the color went on more evenly. Almost embarrassing to wear because the splotchiness is difficult to even remove so my whole day has weird uneven colored lips","Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"416","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Gel Lip Tint Lipstick","RD302 not really red","Amazon Customer","Was hoping for a maroon red, which is what the product pictures show. When you put this on it is thin and wet, and doesn’t really dry down so you have to blott or wipe it off. Once you wipe it off it’s bright pink. The picture I added shows what it looks like before you wipe it off, and then after you wipe it off. Seems to stain just fine if you like the color pink, just wasn’t what I was looking for.","Reviewed in the United States on 13 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It is definitely not a blood red but more pink/purple toned. Pretty if you want that color, but this is rarely a color that goes with my coloring (fair skinned with dark reddish brown hair…I need the blood reds or warm reds).Disappointed, would order another color but since this one was off from the pic I’m afraid to. It is saturated and has staying power, so those are the good things.Idk… maybe the company will see this review and ship me a true Dracula color like the pic…one can dream lol","Reviewed in the United States on 20 January 2022","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"431","ETUDE Dear Darling Water Gel Lip Tint Lipstick","I truly do not understand all the rave reviews","Theresa S.","This has such great reviews I HAD to try it because my holy grail product would be a lip stain that actually stays on. This… does not. I bought 3 colors, two of them darker reds. One is absurdly bright/garish when first applied and leaves only a barely noticeable stain if blotted. The other is a gorgeous deep red that is beautiful with two or three coats (blotted in between). The problem with all three is that the stain doesn’t even last an hour after you apply it. If you eat, drink, or lick your lips, it’s GONE. Also, if you lick your lips, it WILL get on your teeth.I don’t know if all the rave reviews have some secret to the way they apply it, but the product I received absolutely did not live up to those reviews.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 May 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"667","Maybelline New York Hydrating Lip Gloss - Silk","Nice product","Janneth","Sono sincera ho utilizzato per anni rossetti a lunga tenuta, che seccavano le mie labbra, ed apparivano molto secche anche con il rossetto, non era molto estetico, ho iniziato ad applicare solo balsami labbra colorati o trasparenti, tanto sotto la mascherina non vi è molta differenza, ahime'.Ho testato molti gloss, ma l'antiestetico effetto appiccicoso, non fa per me, quindi avevo molte aspettative in questo  di "" Maybelline New York Lifter Gloss, Lucidalabbra con acido ialuronico, Effetto rimpolpante e idratante '', oggetto della mia recensione.Saranno aspettative attese????Il packaging merita menzione, in quanto è veramente bello, sembra di avere tra le mani un prodotto di fascia alta, molto curato dalla grafica all'estetica, veramente promosso.L'applicatore floccato è maxi, come il trend lo vuole, ma utilissimo per l'applicazione, segue perfettamente l'anatomia delle labbra senza sbavature.§§§§§  TEXTURE & PIGMENTAZIONE §§§§§La texture è molto fluida, ma risulta molto leggera, nel senso che non da fastidio, non crea spessori, non ha l'effetto appiccicoso dei soliti gloss, l'applicazione risulta scorrevole e immediata anche grazie alla sua pigmentazione piena, almeno nella colorazione da me scelta,  ovvero '' Silk ''.Questa colorazione è un nude rosato, lo adoro in quanto si sposa benissimo con il tono delle mie labbra,  lo si puo' utilizzare sia per trucchi nude, sia per make up piu' strutturati, insomma risulta portabile in ogni occasione.Ha un effetto brillante, che pian piano si attenua, ma continua a rimanere il colore, per cui non ha una durata eccelsa, ma è un gloss, pero' rispetto ai classici lucidalabbra, resiste di piu'.Le mie labbra risultano idratate, piene e belle,  sicuramente aiuta l'effetto brillante e l'acido ialuronico  presente nella formulazione, mi trovo davvero bene, anche ad utilizzarlo con la mascherina.Sicuramente, presto provero' altre colorazioni.§§§ Colorazioni Disponibili §§§Le colorazioni non sono tante, ma credo che rispettino tutti i gusti, di seguito:- 001 Pearl  dovrebbe essere trasparente- 002 Ice, un rosa pallido- 004 Silk  la colorazione rosa nude scelta da me (vedi foto)- 005 Petal un rosa piu' scuro, ma sempre nude, questo sara' la mia prossima referenza colore.- 006 Reef un rosa chiaro- 007 Amber è il nude per eccellenza, ma con toni sul marrone, non sta bene su alcuni sotto toni, tipo il  mio, sta molto bene invece a chi ha una pelle chiara.La quantità di prodotto contenuta è di 5.4ml mentre, la durata dalla data di apertura è di circa 24 mesi.La formulazione è accettabile, troverete il dettaglio dell'inci verde, rosso o giallo, nelle foto della mia recensione, di seguito l'elenco senza dettaglio dei valori.Vi posso gia' dire, che l'acido  ialuronico  non è impiegato in grandi quantita', ma è normale, anche perche' altrimenti il costo sarebbe decisamente piu' alto, il resto degli ingredienti non è verde, ma per me è assolutamente accettabile.C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Polybutene, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Diisostearyl Malate, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Saccharin, Sorbic Acid, Alumina, Silica, Polybutylene Terephthalate, Trihydroxystearin, Cocos Nucifera Oil / Coconut Oil, Aluminum Hydroxide, Ethylene/Va Copolymer, Acrylates Copolymer, Tin Oxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Tocopherol, Magnesium Silicate, Glucomannan, Parfum / Fragrance.La spedizione super veloce, arriva con il sigillo, per cui non corriamo nessun rischio.Personalmente, lo adoro, sia da solo, sia sopra ad altri rossetti con una texture piu' secca.Ciao","Reviewed in Poland on 7 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"673","Maybelline New York Hydrating Lip Gloss - Silk","003 Moon, mein Lieblings-Lipgloss","poussinette","Ich mag an mir keine stark geschminkten Lippen, weshalb ich immer schon lieber zum Lipgloss statt Lippenstift gegriffen habe.Ich habe mich für die Farbe Moon entschieden. Sie weist dezente Glitzerpartikel und nur eine sehr dezente Tönung auf. Die eigene Lippenfarbe wird intensiviert und erhält tollen Glanz. Ich bin sehr blass und meine Lippen sind von Natur aus schon recht rötlich. Mir gefällt das Ergebnis bei mir sehr gut. Wer eher blasse Lippen im Vergleich zum Teint hat, und sich etwas mehr Tönung wünscht, sollte lieber zu einer anderen Farbnuance greifen. Die anderen aus der Reihe sind nämlich deutlich intensiver färbend. Meine Freundin, auf die das zutrifft, hat die Farbe Silk. Die steht ihr wunderbar.Typisch Lipgloss hält die Farbe auf den Lippen nicht lang. Das notwendige Nachschminken nach ca. 2 Stunden oder nach dem Essen stört mich nicht. Wer länger anhaltende Farbe sucht  wird generell nicht mit einem Lipgloss zufrieden sein.Die Ligloss der Reihe sorgen für gepflegte Lippen, sie kleben nicht und haben einen leichten Geschmack nach Kaffee. Kannte ich so noch nicht, mag ich aber sehr.","Reviewed in France on 20 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Very hydrating if you have dry lips but want a bit of color and shine that will stay put but not feel too heavy.  Color coverage is full like a lipstick, not a sheer tint. Has shine but not overly glossy. Probably the best lip color and moisturizer combo I've ever tried and the price point is great for what it is.

I have had other brands in the past, including the more expensive ones, but this is I think the best of the bunch,  mixes well with lipstick colour not making very much difference. It looks coloured in the bottle, but once on your lips, is barely noticeable. I put it on about ten minutes before applying lipstick, which gives it time to 'do it's stuff'  . Lips don't tingle as much as with other lip plumpers which made me wonder whether I had made a mistake, but the results after a few minutes convinced me that this is a great product. There is a slightly sweet taste, but not at all unpleasant,  and there is a slight odour which you can smell once its on, but that again, isn't unpleasant at all.

Essendoci poi l’acido ialuronico penetra nelle pieghetta delle labbra e rende le labbra rimpolpate, dando un effetto lip filler!

Aber das ist nicht weiter schlimm.Ergänzt man den Lipgloss noch mit einem tollen Lipliner, dann wird das Ergebnis einfach traumhaft.✅😊FAZIT--------------Endlich habe ich einen Lipgloss gefunden, welcher nicht nur toll aussieht sondern auch meine Suche beendet hat und mir immer ein Lächeln ins Gesicht zaubert. 💋Sehr zu empfehlen. 😊","Reviewed in Spain on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"781","Maybelline New York Hydrating Lip Gloss - Topaz","Ecco la verità!","Leanne Myles","Buongiorno ragazze,se vi aspettate di avere le labbra come Angelina Jolie con l'utilizzo di questo prodotto, SCORDATEVELO! Non è la sua funzione. Ho letto recensioni in cui parlano di un formicolio sulle labbra dopo l'applicazione, personalmente io non ho sentito nulla. I colori di questo gloss della Maybelline sono tutti molto belli, hanno una idratazione fantastica. Come si vede nella foto sopra, dopo l'applicazione le labbra sembrano subito più sane e piene. Non sbava e non appiccica. Profuma di vaniglia. Una pecca molto importante secondo me è la durata del colore ahimè, dopo sole 2 ore il colore svanisce e rimane solo il lucido trasparente come se avessi un normale balsamo labbra, perciò vi consiglio di portarlo con voi se vi piace avere le labbra sempre colorate come me. Nel complesso è un buon prodotto, perché il suo colore ( anche se devo rimetterlo dopo poco tempo) e la sua idratazione mi piacciono molto. Il prezzo intorno ai 6,00€ direi che è buono.Grazie per aver dedicato qualche secondo a leggere la mia recensione, spero vi sia utile.","Reviewed in Australia on 4 March 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"812","Maybelline New York Hydrating Lip Gloss - Topaz","It works , does what it's supposed to do.","Neve","first time I have used this product. I have had other brands in the past, including the more expensive ones, but this is I think the best of the bunch,  mixes well with lipstick colour not making very much difference. It looks coloured in the bottle, but once on your lips, is barely noticeable. I put it on about ten minutes before applying lipstick, which gives it time to 'do it's stuff'  . Lips don't tingle as much as with other lip plumpers which made me wonder whether I had made a mistake, but the results after a few minutes convinced me that this is a great product. There is a slightly sweet taste, but not at all unpleasant,  and there is a slight odour which you can smell once its on, but that again, isn't unpleasant at all. I will be sticking to this one from now on.","Reviewed in Australia on 29 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Il colore che ho preso io è trasparente però ha una luminosità unica ed è stupendo, la caratteristica di questo prodotto è infatti che è un glosso molto lucido effetto specchio, per niente appiccicoso sembra quasi un olio di quanto è morbido e non si sente sulle labbra. Essendoci poi l’acido ialuronico penetra nelle pieghetta delle labbra e rende le labbra rimpolpate, dando un effetto lip filler! Ha un leggero sapore dolciastro che non da per niente fastidio e un leggero odore che nemmeno questo da fastidio, un gloss che devono avere tutt*.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Aber das ist nicht weiter schlimm.Ergänzt man den Lipgloss noch mit einem tollen Lipliner, dann wird das Ergebnis einfach traumhaft.✅😊FAZIT--------------Endlich habe ich einen Lipgloss gefunden, welcher nicht nur toll aussieht sondern auch meine Suche beendet hat und mir immer ein Lächeln ins Gesicht zaubert. 💋Sehr zu empfehlen. 😊","Reviewed in Spain on 29 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"831","Maybelline New York Hydrating Lip Gloss - Topaz","Ecco la verità!","Leanne Myles","Buongiorno ragazze,se vi aspettate di avere le labbra come Angelina Jolie con l'utilizzo di questo prodotto, SCORDATEVELO! Non è la sua funzione. Ho letto recensioni in cui parlano di un formicolio sulle labbra dopo l'applicazione, personalmente io non ho sentito nulla. I colori di questo gloss della Maybelline sono tutti molto belli, hanno una idratazione fantastica. Come si vede nella foto sopra, dopo l'applicazione le labbra sembrano subito più sane e piene. Non sbava e non appiccica. Profuma di vaniglia. Una pecca molto importante secondo me è la durata del colore ahimè, dopo sole 2 ore il colore svanisce e rimane solo il lucido trasparente come se avessi un normale balsamo labbra, perciò vi consiglio di portarlo con voi se vi piace avere le labbra sempre colorate come me. Nel complesso è un buon prodotto, perché il suo colore ( anche se devo rimetterlo dopo poco tempo) e la sua idratazione mi piacciono molto. Il prezzo intorno ai 6,00€ direi che è buono.Grazie per aver dedicato qualche secondo a leggere la mia recensione, spero vi sia utile.","Reviewed in Australia on 4 March 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"896","Maybelline New York Superstay Vinyl Ink Longwear Liquid Lipstick in Coy",NA,"Hetty","I love this colour, it's called Royal and matches Medium Brown skin very nicely, it's not too dark and bright enough for people to comment about how nice it looks. I am not used to wearing or applying long lasting lipsticks so it takes awhile for me to clear up mistakes as it really does stay on. I find if you have a few drinks, the inside of the lipstick does goes away and you can reapply. I use a clear lipstick over the top as there is a slight stickiness to it the entire time and that solves the problem. To remove it, I use Baby Oil and it comes off like magic. I have bought other colours since, and although it gets removed on the inside part of the lips, it's not so obvious with the lighter colours such as Coy. I recommend you trying this.","Reviewed in Australia on 25 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"902","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Beautiful but I’m confused","Allison","Let me start off by saying this is a beautiful lip gloss/stick/blur tint color. I’m not sure what to call it. It says it’s a lip tint but it wasn’t a lip blur or tint on my lips. It just wore like a lipstick on me. I put it on expecting it to turn into one of those super drying and sticky long lasting lip colors, but I was pleasantly surprised when my lips stayed feeling moisturized. The transfer is bad and when you wipe it off it is gone without a tint, but if you leave it alone it is very pretty and keeps your lips moist. If you just plan on talking and looking pretty instead of eating, drinking and smooching your in the clear.  I love the color and the fact that it doesn’t get sticky and flakey, so if I am going to be in a situation where I can reapply when I eat or drink (I’ve been married too long to smooch in public anymore) then I will definitely keep this one in mind.

I really wanted to love it because I've heard such great things about Moonshot products, but this one was not for me.Here are my thoughts:1️⃣ The color is terrible on me. I did not deduct stars for this though because color is based on personal preferences.2️⃣ This lipstick is not at all moisturizing for me as it claims it is. In fact, it has the complete opposite effect and dries my lips out, making them looks like prunes.3️⃣ The title of this product could really confuse some people shopping for lipstick. Is it a blur? A tint? A lipstain? A velvet matte lipstick? It's important to make that distinction because they are NOT all the same. What I can tell you from trying this lip product is that it feels closer to a matte lipstick for me.4️⃣ It most certainly transfers.Overall, it wasn't the worst lipstick I've ever tried, but there are much better products out there in the same price range.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 May 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars",NA

While I didn't hate this product, it didn't quite live up to my expectations as a lip tint. If you're looking for a softer, more subtle lip look, it's great. However, in my opinion, it doesn't provide the longevity I hoped for. The velvet matte finish is lovely, and the avocado protein is a nice touch.

It's easy to apply and looks great when you first put it on.However, since they stressed so much that it is transfer-proof in the listing, I will just say, NO, it is not transfer proof. It smudges very easily and definitely transfers. It doesn't stay on long if you do normal things like drink or eat something. It is more of a lipstick as it doesn't tint, just sits on the surface of my lips.I really wanted to like this product but I'm completely underwhelmed.

"916","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Lip tint in pretty colors w/cute case, but hard to get a smooth, even finish + smudges easily...","Sandy M","I ordered several of these lip tints for my teen-aged granddaughter. She is always experimenting with different styles and colors of lip products and I thought she might like these blurring tints. I chose the 'savage', 'hidden-card' & 'power hustle' colors for a fun range of shades that are not too dark or too intense. I think the tints do match the shades shown in the picture accompanying the product description pretty well. What doesn't seem to match is the velvety finish. These are referred to as a tint in one part of the description and a stain in another. They do seem closer to a tint than a stain as they are a bit messy and don't last long without smudging. This is definitely not transfer-proof. But they are a little like a lipstick in that the color sits on top of the skin instead of sinking in and unless there is a light coat, it can dry and crack. The consistency isn't really liquid(y) and it is hard to get smooth, even coverage. My granddaughter likes the colors and she says that these work best for her if she applies very lightly, blots to help with the blur effect, and then adds a lip balm afterward. The current price of $15.00 does seem a bit high to me, but the case is very cute.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars",NA
"917","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Pretty color, long-lasting, non-drying💋","SuLu","I really like so many K-Beauty skincare and makeup products and this MoonShot lipstick is one of them.I don't really get the lip blur/fix part of it but that's okay since I love this color and love the way it looks on my lips.Just be sure to wipe some of the color from the applicator or else it'll go on too thick. That's one problem with this lip stain: it is a little thick and dry-feeling while applying, and I do worry it won't last a long time in the tube. However, if I don't put too much on the sponge applicator or use my own lip brush, I can control the amount and have way better results.This color -- Knockout -- is a knockout! You can see from my photos that the color pretty well matches what they have advertised, but I thought it would be more of an orangey-red and this has more pinks in it —however it's flattering to my skin-tone so I’m not unhappy with this color at all.If I put a thin layer on my lips, this lasts a long time. I can drink, lightly kiss, and eat (as long as it's not something oily or buttery), and still have stain left over.It is maybe just a tad drying to my lips but that could also be because our humidity is so low right now and I so far don't have the urge to put lipbalm on my lips and it's been a couple of hours. It doesn't give my lips that 'cracked lip' dry look or as I wear it and drink water, etc, it doesn't start fading out in a drying way. That's a plus.The packaging is happy and pretty and the tube is very nice too. I like the more flattened top--easy to hold.I am happy with my order!Thank you for reading my reviews! ☺️","Reviewed in the United States on 8 October 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Its semi reminiscent of this revlon matte gloss I love, but its just way more expensive. I think the price could be a lot lower. I also feel like calling it a stain or tint is misleading.

It doesn't dry-out your lips like other “matte” products that I have used (it's more of a semi-matte). The color was beautiful and natural looking on my Mac NC30 colored skin. My lips are naturally pretty tinted so it was hard to get a ""blurred look"" using this product. Not really a fault of the product though.Remember to use the product properly if you are desiring a more ""blurred"" effect. It's really about how you apply the product versus the product itself.  It helps to layer the products and letting it dry between layers and blending in between.It does feel nice on your lips at first application. It doesn't stay on very long though (about 2 hours).

"921","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Too thick for me","TorchLit","Any tint or lip stain I’ve used is more of a liquid, gloss consistency. This is in a tube, so I expected it to be a bit more fluid. It’s like someone crushed up a lipstick and put it in a tube with an applicator. It goes on thick, which is not good on older lips. Every little crevice and microwrinkle was highlighted. If I kept it right within my lip line, it was better. The color sits on my lip. It doesn’t blend in or tint and it wipes right off even after it’s set for a bit. The color, “Keen” is more orange brown than the picture shows, where it looks more like a mauve shade On me, it looked like I’d smeared my lips with some discolored food. Not complementary to my coloring because it didn’t look like it did in the picture to me. It might be my monitor, but it’s not the same color family. I find this drying, like I do many lipsticks. I feels heavy on my lips, like a mask, and unfortunately unpleasant. Your results may vary, since this review is about my skin, my sensitivities, my coloring.

No sticky residue or weird taste and it’s long lasting enough. I always have to reapply, regardless of the brand but the biggest thing is what I have to do to reapply. This, I can just put more over my lips, no need to completely remove. That’s a big thing for me.

I do like the blur affect  it’s a lively color, this is my first time trying a velvet type lip so I was surprised at how smooth it went on when I applied it.

I found it to be more anti-smudge if you blot it on a napkin once or twice - it did not rub off on my teeth or move outside of where I placed it (I did not use lip liner of any kind for this example).I tried to coat it on thick enough to fill in the lip cracks, but it didn't seem to make a difference for me - maybe my cracks are too deep or numerous. Unfortunately in my case I felt like it made my lips look dry (even though they were not, they felt smooth and hydrated).

I wouldn't say it's transfer proof (I have never personally experience any lipsticks that does not transfer) so I don't know why companies keep making this claim.

That tint faded a bit after I applied this.I love the container which is pretty unusual since this is a liquid lip and the packaging is hard with a standard doe foot applicator and it twists open.  This won't get lost in your purse or open easily.

"939","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Beautiful!","MJ","This color is actually so beautiful.

"940","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Not exactly as described but not terrible","Sama","I got this in power hustle. It’s really pretty but has a bit more of a pink undertone than a red from what it appeared online. The formula isn’t runny, glossy or really gloopy. Not quite sure how to describe it honestly. I suppose it’s kind of velvety. The applicator is okay - doesn’t smooth it out as well as my finger does. It feels kind of drying on my lips and I’m not a fan of that feeling lol. I thought this would be more of a tint thing where it didn’t feel drying but it isn’t. It does smudge and doesn’t leave a tint on your lips if you wipe it off. So it is transferable. The color is very pigmented and pretty but not quite what is advertised.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 November 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"942","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","pretty","Momma Becky","This MOONSHOT Performance Lip Blur Fixing Tint is a really pretty color but I wouldn't call it a blur or a tint. It makes a pretty good matte lipstick though. It stays on for a good while as long as I don't mess with it. But if I drink anything, it comes off on my glass. So, it does transfer. It does a decent job of moisturizing while it's on and if I want a bit of sparkle, I just apply a lip gloss overtop the lipstick. This may not be the long lasting tint or blur I expected, but I'm still pretty happy with it.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA
"943","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","not sure it worked","nekojita","I got this in Hidden Card, which was more pink than magenta when I put it on. I understand the blurred lips concept, and I've tried using this a couple of times. It didn't feel drying to me, which is good. It did transfer after I used it, which wasn't as nice. It didn't seem to build up much at all; I tried to concentrate it on certain parts of my lips and leave the edges more blurred out, but it all looked the same.

"944","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Pretty but a little problematic!","Kelz R","While I think this is a pretty color lippie, it doesn’t stay put!  It smears and smudges well after being applied!  I couldn’t get it to look even because it was still splotchy after the second layer.  I would probably have to line my lips really well underneath before applying it again.

"945","MOONSHOT Performance Blur Fixing Tint","Pretty color; odd texture","Kelz R","This lip color does ""blur"" like the pictures indicate.  The color in person is true to the picture in the shade I received.  I don't find that my lips feel particularly moisturized when using this, but neither do they feel dried out--neutral for me on that.  The color lasts-ish...it doesn't fade completely even after quite a few hours; however, it is maybe only 50% as bright as it was on initial application.  It is very matte with absolutely no shine whatsoever.  If that is what you want & you like the color, this would be a good choice.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 October 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"1001","Peripera Ink Velvet #3 Red Only, 4 g","Great lip color that doesn't transfer","NYC","This was a Prime Day recommendation and I took a chance!  In short, great product for the. money. My favorite lip stain is a water based one and no longer available. This is not at all like that, but a lip color that is very highly pigmented (I got the red color) It has to be applied carefully, and since it comes with a sponge tip. For more precise application, I used a lip brush.  No problem...it stays in place, doesn't bleed. I will say it looked great immediately. Matte, which is the trend now.  I continue to wear my mask, and I could NOT believe it absolutely did NOT transfer on the mask, even after being outdoor for hours in 90 degrees with 90 percent humidity! That is amazing as all my other 3x more expensive lipsticks did transfer to the mask (hated). Another benefit is while this is long lasting, it doesn't make your lips dry. You can feel it, but it is not bothersome (I'm super picky). Going on, it has a tiny bit of a flavor, so light that I can't even identify it, but it is pleasant, but it immediately fades. I personally don't want flavored lips.  I would bill this a a long-wearing lip color, not a true lip stain. It is a GREAT product for the money.

"1018","Peripera Ink Velvet #3 Red Only, 4 g","Ok Year Update- MY DENTIST REQUESTED BRAND AND SHADE","Lisa","Quick update – I had a dental procedure done which included nitrous oxide and a lengthy procedure to which my lipstick remained on flaky and perfectly tinted and at the end of the procedure my dentist asked me the brand and the shade of lipstick I had been using as she had not seen anything like it and was very into make up  herself, or so the front desk said when they asked me for the shade. •As far as MOISTURIZING goes, like most long term lip staining products, this one will apply better if you use a balm or clear colored matte type of uncolored lip base, even chapstick under it will outperform most other brands of long last lip color AND especially for the PRICE. I went with the red one in order to ensure this wasn’t like other sheer colored stains I’ve tried that look dark yet when applied are light pink, and my advice is to believe what the color shows you it will be, as you don’t need to overcompensate on this product. Less is more as well. Just a dab of this smeared across lips goes a king way, or can be used as a lip liner for a very formal pout with the crisp lines of Betty Boop. It can be glossy or matte, as I also recommend using a colored or clear gloss or top coat so that it feels like it is set in and your lips feel like they are not dry. Experiment with different lipsticks or wand colors and you will have produced a color that is entirely “you,” as many people have asked what lipstick shade I’m wearing, and I can’t explain that I combined 3 different products to get the look I wore. Three products that were in my purse at that moment. Bottom line...buy it. A multi use product that will last you a year. And if you don’t like it/worth the $8 to find out if not because you can easily regift it, to your sister on her next staycation she gets paid for.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 February 2021","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I wish they made darker reds/plums - sigh- lol I love that the formula actually appears soft and smooth like velvet. its not oily or patchy or spreads uneven like a watery tint... its has a soft almost airbrushed appearance. Not a totally dry dry liquid matte lip has a mousse consistency which i like, its not so drying, but if you would prefer to matte it down just dab on a napkin it doesnt transfer much after. My only complaint is it doesnt last after eating. i attached photos after application and after eating. If youre looking for something that requires less touch ups i recommend the airy ink velvets instead they last longer or the ink gelato series from peripera :) those are my go to so far.

I even came back to grab a few more colors because the pricepoint is great! I'm obsessed with matte lipsticks! What I'm not obsessed with is how most matte lipsticks leave your lips dry, cakey, and flakey! NOT THIS ONE. The texture of this product is phenomenal! So lightweight, barely feels like anything is on my lips when it dries. Substantially more comfortable than typical lipsticks. Instead of intensifying the cracks in my lips, it smoothed right over them. It leaves my lips looking plumped and perfectly matte. A little bit of this product goes a long way so be sure not to apply too much! I found applying a dab in the center of your lips and using your finger to spread and pat around gives the best effect! I like this lipstick even more than my Jeffree Star Liquid lipsticks! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a lightweight matte lipstick.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 April 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1053","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","Excellent Lipstick","Mariana Fernandez","I’ve been using Mineral Fusion lipstick for years, but have only used the colour Burst until today when I bought Peony. I’d been looking for more of a red lipstick, and was happy to find this one! It’s not true red, but that wasn’t what I was after! I was happy to find it was a nice spiced red with notes of rust and pink, and a cool undertone. Great for fall/winter photos!The lipstick is nicely moisturizing, and lasts a long time. (Tip for any lipstick: apply, blot, apply another coat.)The scent is kind of a soft sweet smell, and for some reason, reminds me of the smell of play dough. Not offensive in my opinion, but if you don’t like it, you don’t like it.Overall, I’m just really pleased with this product. I don’t always get to give a 5 star review!

"1057","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","Mineral Fusion Burst is my go-to color","Laura","I’m a fair-skinned Asian with dark brown hair, and Mineral Fusion’s Burst color is my favorite color to wear day or night. It’s a natural salmon/warm pink thrat’s just enough color without being too much color. It can be worn without lipliner, and has just enough thick/creamy texture for good coverage. If your lips have a slightly darker shade to them, this color also balances well against that too.I like it in summer as well as winter months. You do have to be careful about ordering this online in hot summer months, because it can arrived softened which makes the lipstick want to fall off the base as soon as you apply it. Try cooling it off first. I’ve also sometimes found Mineral Fusion lipsticks at Whole Foods, although the Burst color is usually not in stock in stores.I really like that it’s fragrance free and paraben free, and the seed oils and cocoa butter make it moisturizing to reapply throughout the day.","Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Obviously the longevity of the product was a bust. In terms of how long it stayed on my lips? The edges stayed long after the rest of the product came off. Was it flattering? Not for me. I'm in my late 60s, so this lipstick not only bled off the edges of my lips but highlighted wrinkles in my lips.

"1066","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","Probably flattering for someone else","Santa Maria","This lipstick has a feel that is somehow dry and oily at the same time, probably due to the mineral powder fighting with the moisturizing ingredients. That doesn't sound good, but it's not actually uncomfortable, stays on, and isn't sticky, although I find I need to blot it. I blot most lipsticks, however.I bought this in Ruby and Peony. I am reviewing Ruby here. I thought it was a pretty pinky-red shade, and it is, but it is a bit dull. It has slightly greyish undertones (I have olive skin). If you subscribe to the four seasons theory of colour, I'm pretty sure it is a summer lipstick, whereas I am a winter. It is quite pretty, but I find it a little dull on me.The one real issue I have with this lipstick is its scent. It's very strong and not all that pleasant. I don't think it smells as if it has gone bad or anything. It is just heavily scented with a sort of chemical smell I don't like. Worse even than L'Oreal.Otherwise, it comes in a pretty metallic tube that feels heavy and ""expensive"". That's on the plus side of things.

I bought a similar shade of lip pencil from the same brand. I highly recommend applying the lip liner on your lips first before this. It def helps with making it last longer.I started to get allergic reactions to my previous makeup (with is why i finally decided to switch) and now theyve completely stopped. I don't have to worry about how my skin will look/ feel after I put makeup on.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 April 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1087","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","I really liked this lipstick at first, but it broke inside the tube and it is unusable.","irish rose","I really liked this lipstick at first, but it broke inside the tube and it is unusable. The color is very nice, but the lipstick should not break.  The packaging is a problem with several Mineral Fusion products.  In this case the lipstick breaks in the tube and in the case of the powder foundation the lid hinge breaks.  This is a shame because the lipstick and the foundation are very good, but in the end you are paying for a cosmetic that cannot be used shortly after opening.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1091","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","Very hydrating","SpringtimeSong","This lipstick makes your lips feel very hydrated. I’m bought the NUDE color and it is a very nice color. The formula isn’t super thick and sort of melts into your lips. The colors to choose from in the pics are terrible and don’t match the actual product. I went to YouTube to find people who bought and actually swatched the product before choosing my color. The smell took me back a bit when I first applied the lipstick and I was disappointed I wouldn’t be able to deal with it, but over time I got used to it and I don’t mind it at all now. The color lasts somewhat if you let the lipstick “dry” or soak into your lips before doing anything that would mess it up. Overall, I love that the ingredients are non-toxic and that it is hydrating. This is the most hydrating lipstick I own. I would love to try some of their other lips products.","Reviewed in the United States on 14 August 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1092","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","I really like this pink/ coral color","A","So I love Mineral Fusion lipsticks, despite the conflicting reviews. They have great colors, are moisturizing, wear well during a day, are safe for those with gluten allergies, and worth the expense. I’ve been using their makeup on & off for several years.Im trying to get spring ready and am working on finding the perfect pink/ coral mix. I use to love the color Orgasm by NARS, but am no longer able to use it. INSPIRE is closer to what I am going for. Although I did just order Crush. So I’ll do a comparison once I receive it.The color is very attractive. Works well with my skin tone, which is fair with a yellow undertone. I did a test on my wrist with a comparison of colors. But it’s deceptive. And hard to see what those lipsticks truly look like. They appear very sheer in the image but are actually not.Inspire is a medium pink with a coral/ orange undertone. It would probably look attractive on most skin tones. A good neutral that can be topped with gloss if needed.. Not overly bright. I can see this working well for the transition into spring/ summer.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 January 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1098","Mineral Fusion Lipstick, Alluring","Wow, purpley! But pretty and durable.","Steph","My migraines are triggered by FD&C red dyes, so I primarily bought this lipstick because it's one of the few brands that I can wear safely!  Yay for that! This is a good purchase and I wear it pretty often. The formula for some reason is quite drying, though, and if you don't exfoliate your lips, it will tint the dryer areas more deeply than the rest. It stays on very well and keeps its sparkle. VERY pigmented! Even a light application gives a bold color.On to the color. I have dark brown hair and cool ivory skin (pink undertones), and this is an OK shade on me. VERY purple! Much more purple than it looks in the picture.  It's about as close to purple as you can go while still calling the color 'red' - deep fuschia, perhaps. Something close to Pantone 208 PC. It looks good on me, but I was hoping for something redder. Mineral Fusion's ""Mystery"" is a good alternative, if you prefer something less purple but still shaded for cool-toned skin.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 December 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Looks natural and is buildable, but you don't need much.  Wait a few minutes before adding more.  It lasted all day and feels light on your skin.  Love it on skin.Lips: If your lips are very dry, you need to exfoliate dry lips first or it will pill on your lips.  It's not drying on lips, but not very moisturizing either.  I like the color on my pale lips as it makes them look darker and still very natural and subtle.  The only downside is it doesn't last long on my lips, but nothing does.  After the morning application, I'd rather reapply a $5 tinted balm in my pocket that I can use all day for more moisture.I'd still reorder it, but only because I think it looks very good on skin.

"1131","Jane Iredale Just Kissed Lip Stain, Forever Pink","Der Preis ist unverschämt","Meli Sander","Ich war sehr neugierig auf diesen Lipplumper, da die Marke Jane Iredale im Internet sehr gut bewertet wird und ich eine Möglichkeit gesucht habe den Lippen eine möglichst zarte, natürliche aber doch intensivere Farbe zu verleihen. Außerdem hat mich fasziniert, dass je nach ph-Wert der Haut das Ergebnis unterschiedlich ausfallen kann, gegen ein bisschen Aufpolsterung hätte ich auch nichts :-).Als der Stift nach einigen Tagen ankam war ich erst mal ernüchtert, es ist eher ein Lippenstiftchen (ca. 0,9cm Durchmesser und 2,5cm lang ist die Lippenstiftsäule, also das eigentliche Material). Aber die Neugierde hat mich davon abgehalten den Stift sofort zurück zu schicken.Nach dem Auftragen merkt man ein wenig Prickeln aber nicht unangenehm, das ein Weilchen anhält. Die Färbung hat sich nach ca.2 min ausgebildet, nicht ganz was ich wollte aber doch nahe daran. Zur Veranschaulichung habe ich 2 Bilder hochgeladen (davor und ca.10 min danach). Man sieht ganz gut die Farbveränderung und das sich die Lippen leicht (wirklich nur sehr zart) aufpolstern. Sehr positiv finde ich, dass das Ergebnis sehr lange anhält und die Lippen natürlich schimmern, wenn man nicht gerade Spaghetti isst auch noch nach dem Essen. Geschmacklich ist der Stift neutral.Fazit: Den Preis finde ich unverschämt (deshalb einen Stern Abzug, dabei ist er hier über amazon noch deutlich günstiger als bei anderen Anbietern), das Ergebnis aber gut und die Haltbarkeit nach dem Auftragen deutlich besser als alles was mir bisher begegnet ist.update: 16.4.2015 Ich benutze den Lippenstift fast jeden Tag, mehr als 2-3 mal pro Tag ist nicht nötig, um eine anhaltende Tönung zu erreichen. Ich habe ihn im letzten August gekauft und nun ist er erst ca. zur Hälfte aufgebraucht.

Il rossetto nonostante sia un matte non risulta secco, anzi idrata molto le labbra e sembra quasi di mettere un burrocacao. Si riesce ad essere molto precisi nell'applicarlo.Ha una buona tenuta, è riuscito a resistere alla fastidiosa condensa sotto una ffp2 e ha resistito egregiamente per ore dopo aver sorriso, parlato e bevuto.La cosa che più mi ha sorpresa è l'effetto matte, è super opaco, ma anche idratante e morbido, caratteristiche che difficilmente si trovano contemporaneamente in un rossetto.Piacevole la leggera nota floreale, invece l'effetto volumizzante sinceramente io non l'ho sperimentato, probabilmente è legato al colore che ho scelto.Nel complesso è un ottimo prodotto, lo consiglio a tutte.","Reviewed in Italy on 26 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Positiv ist jedoch, dass die Tassen nach dem Spülen in der Maschine alle wieder makellos sauber wurden. Er wird also auch hier gut ""abgeschmolzen"" und entfernt.","Reviewed in Germany on 13 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1248","L'Oreal Paris Color Riche Intense Volume","Rossetto matte ma davvero idratante!","Anita","La prima cosa da dire su questo rossetto è che il pack è davvero bello e di qualità, uno stick vellutato e sottile di colore nero e oro contiene la tinta, la chiusura è salda e non c'è il rischio che possa aprirsi da solo se messo in borsa o in un beautycase..Il rossetto ha un'ottima profumazione, il colore è molto pigmentato e vibrante, una volta applicato rende le labbra matte ma al contempo non tira e non fa antiestetiche pieghette, è molto nutriente e confortevole. Sembra quasi di applicare un burro cacao o un balsamo labbra, infatti è molto scorrevole e non secca..Il colore 188 ""Le Rose Activist"" è un bel rosa intenso e carico, vira leggermente sul fucsia ma senza la componente eccessivamente accesa.. Perfetto per la stagione estiva!","Reviewed in Italy on 16 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1249","L'Oreal Paris Color Riche Intense Volume","Consigliatissimo","Anita","Non mi piacciono i rossetti lucidi preferisco di gran lunga quelli matte come questi anche se tendono a seccare le labbra più facilmente.  L’Oréal Paris Rossetto Color Riche Intense Volume Matte invece dona un bellissimo colore matte e non secca per niente le labbra donandole un piacevole effetto volumizzante. E' molto morbido e si stende benissimo, la durata è ottima e non vi ritroverete il prodotto solo nelle pieghette dopo poche ora. Il packaging è molo elegante e raffinato, perfetto da mettere nelle pochette. Io ho preso la tonalità 482 Mauve Indompta perché mi piacciono i nude rosati ma penso che acquisterò anche qualche altro colore più acceso perché sono rimasta davvero stupita da questo rossetto.","Reviewed in Italy on 25 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It’s subtle, and I don’t mind it.As for having to use lip liner or whatever prepping some makeup aficionados might to when wearing lipstick, I did t do any of that. I do notice that after a while of eating/drinking and using napkins, it wears off and I’m left with lined-lips, but that’s my experience with most lipsticks.I definitely recommend this if your looking for a pop of color to wear.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

If you are after a nice matte lip without the uncomfortable drying feeling then these are diffinately a good shout.The only thing I would highly recommend about these is that you go and watch swatch videos on YouTube as the colours don't look the same as they do on the photos on here so i think it's best to go watch someone putting them on before you pick one!Beautiful, still in love and will be raving about these for the rest of my life!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 June 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1319","Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor, HD Kisses","Buy your Revelon liquid lippies from Amazon because","LegallyBrunette","I barely review lipsticks but this one stole my heart for two reasons:1. Amazon does a great job when It comes to selling these lippies well packaged. I used to get mine at my local drugstore. Almost every tube seemed opened and swatched. I would end up leaving the store empty handed as I’m aware of the long list of diseases associated with sharing lipsticks (mono, common cold, Hepatitis B and herpes are just a few). I am not a germophobe in any sense; but I have became more sensative to my makeup hygiene after watching the Markerplace episode on cosmetics.I ordered the shade Forever from Amazon. My tube came packaged in a plastic wrap. Sealed. New. Fresh, un swatched liquid lipstick. I’ve posted a photo of it so you get the idea. It was so satisfying to open the package.2. The formula is great. It’s one of the most comfortable matte liquid lippie I have ever tried. I also love that the applicator is fairly flat so not too much product comes out of the tube when you take the applicator out. This which makes it very precise line. It dries on the lips quickly, leaving a comfortable matte finish. Has a sweet scent, but no one that’s overpowering.The shade Forever (a muddy pink nude) is pretty much my own lips shade, but better. If you are looking for an everyday nude (with pink/brown undertone) that wouldn’t smudge on you, nor would it hurt your wallet, I’d suggest giving this shade a try. It’s very close to NYX’s Soft Matte lippie in shade Stockholm, but with a better staying power.I hope this was helpful to all my makeup lovers out there :)","Reviewed in Canada on 15 August 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Bisher war meine Lieblingsfarbe ""Embrace"", aber auch ""Kisses"" und ""Devotion"" nutze ich ab und an. Jetzt habe ich ""Seduction"" für mich entdeckt - mein neuer Favorit! Die Farbe ist noch dezenter als ""Embrace"" und damit prima für den Alltag geeignet.Wer einen super deckenden und kussechten Lippenstift erwartet, wird aber enttäuscht werden. Salopp gesagt ist es (meiner Meinung nach) eher sowas wie eine pigmentierte Lippenpflege 😁 Dadurch trocknen die Lippen nicht aus, aber die Farbe muss öfter nachgezogen werden. Ich persönlich bin damit total zufrieden.Die Konsistenz ist cremig, der Geruch gewohnt angenehm - Revlon halt. 😊","Reviewed in Germany on 18 March 2021","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The price was good too considering I was paying $28 for one tube of Estee Lauder Pure Envy Lip Gloss which was the same color.  It was discontinued which is why I searched for something comparable on Amazon.  Sometimes I find that gloss with frost can be gritty which is a deal breaker.  This gloss did not have a gritty feel.

I wanted to try something with a tint, so I bought this.  Unfortunately, it burned my lips and they are taking forever to heal.  After a few uses, I noticed my lips stinging and burning when I put this on or ate anything spicy or acidic.  I have stopped using this product and have been diligently using moisturizing lip balms like Acquaphor, but my lips still aren’t out of the woods.  They feel swollen when I wake up in the morning, too.  Just thought I should mention.  I think it might be the peppermint oil in it.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1552","Manhattan Intensive Shimmer Finish Colour","Setzt belebende Akzente auf den Lippenstift","pinkdawn","Ich trage gern Lippenstift. Aber selbst bei teuren Marken bin ich oft mit dem Ergebnis nicht so ganz zufrieden. Besonders Nude Töne, so schön sie auch sind, wirken auf meinen Lippen oft unscheinbar, blass und zu eintönig. Da muss ich dann nachhelfen und der zu unauffälligen oder matten Lippenfarbe etwas mehr Leben einhauchen. Das geschieht am besten mit einem Lipgloss, der ein Highlight auf die Lippen setzt und sie interessanter erscheinen lässt. Den Trick hab ich von einer Maskenbildnerin übernommen samt einem Döschen Highlighter in hellem Lilarosa mit silbrigem Schimmer. Den Highlighter hab ich mit einem Lippenpinsel aufgetragen. Doch irgendwann war das Döschen leer. Ich wollte mir ein ähnliches Produkt beschaffen. Meine Wahl fiel auf den Manhattan Lipgloss Highshine in einem zarten Violettrosa. Dieser Farbton passt erfahrungsgemäß gut zu meiner hellen Haut. Der Highlighter enthält winzige silbrige Partikel, die aber so dezent aussehen, dass sie durchaus alltagstauglich sind.Der Gloss duftet angenehm süß wie ein Bonbon. Er belebt wie erwünscht jeden Lippenstift, lässt ihn weicher und seidiger aussehen.Die transparente altrosa Nuance passt auf fast alle meine Lippenstifte, außer Orangetöne bzw. Coral- oder Terrakotta-Farben.Ich hab mit getöntem Gloss bessere Erfahrungen gemacht als mit farblosem, der oft hart und nicht so sanft schimmernd wirkt.Der Manhattan Highshine verschönert alle Lippenstifte, zu denen er farblich passt. Die Farbe wird leuchtender, heller und hält länger. Ich hab das Gefühl, dass meine Lippen nicht so schnell austrocknen, obwohl ich natürlich hydrierenden Lippenstift verwende.Der Gloss lässt sich mit dem kleinen Schwämmchen leicht auftragen. Die Konsistenz der Creme ist gerade richtig, nicht zu dick und nicht zu dünn.Gut finde ich, dass der Gloss lange Zeit sein frisches, strahlendes Aussehen behält und nicht eintrocknet. Man muss also nicht ständig nachschminken.Ich kann den preisgünstigen sowie ergiebigen Highgloss bestens empfehlen.Ich trage ihn allerdings immer nur auf Lippenstift, nie alleine.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1651","NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss, Angel Food Cake",NA,"AnneAesthetic","I have very, very pale, Winter-toned skin. Matching lip shades to my complexion can be tough when I want a colour to be deep enough to be dramatic (I'm a goth), while also echoing my natural lip-tone to ""light"" the rest of my features. Well, we have a winner.Devils Food Cake is the perfect shade for Snow Whites who want to put a bit of blood into their lips, & it applies just wonderfully - the point of the doe-foot applicator allows for precision application, while still picking up plenty of pigment on each dip. It doesn't smudge easily, with a liner, & it feels comfortable; it's never sticky but somehow also never slimy - more like a glaze than a gloss! It feels conditioning, but not greasy, & I *love* that it's unscented & unflavoured.I don't know how long it'll last on my lips; it *is* only a gloss, after all, & it'd just be unfair to expect it to behave like anything else. But I can say that while it lasts, the colour wears true. And this hue is just *so* flattering for a blue/pink-toned complexion.An absolute steal at twice the price.","Reviewed in Australia on 18 November 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1681","NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss, Angel Food Cake","Luscious Lips with Comfortable Wear","AnneAesthetic","I’ve been using NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss in the Angel Food Cake shade, and it’s quickly become one of my favorites. The true mauve color is beautiful and versatile, suitable for a range of skin tones and occasions.The texture is what stands out the most. Unlike many lip glosses that can feel sticky or heavy, this butter gloss lives up to its name with a smooth, buttery application. It feels comfortable on the lips, and I can wear it for hours without any discomfort.The gloss provides a lovely shine without being overly glossy, striking the perfect balance for those who want a noticeable yet understated look.It’s easy to apply, with a wand that allows for precise and even application. The size of the gloss is also convenient for carrying in a purse or a makeup bag.The gloss is fairly long-lasting for a non-sticky formula, though it does require reapplication after eating or drinking.The reason for giving it four stars is the need for frequent reapplication to maintain the color intensity.Overall, the NYX Professional Makeup Butter Gloss in Angel Food Cake is a fantastic product for anyone looking for a non-sticky, comfortable, and beautifully colored lip gloss. It’s a great addition to any makeup collection for everyday wear or special occasions.","Reviewed in Australia on 18 November 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I bought the peach one this time. The colours are as they appear, in a nice glistening format. It's not sticky at all and doesn't feather or bleed. That being said a little  lip liner wouldn't go amiss. Revlon shine does just that and it's moisturizing, no more dry wrinkly crinkly looking lips. You will have to reapply as its staying power is less than traditional lipsticks, but it is so worth it. They do get a little soft in really hot weather but that's not a deal breaker for me.

Ho recentemente provato il balsamo-roseto per labbra e devo dire che sono rimasto davvero colpito dalla sua qualità. È semplicemente favoloso! Non solo il colore è bellissimo, ma è anche molto piacevole da applicare sulle labbra.Una delle cose che apprezzo di più di questo balsamo-roseto è il suo bellissimo colore. La tonalità è perfetta per donare alle labbra un aspetto naturale e sano. Non è eccessivamente pigmentato, ma offre comunque un tocco di colore delicato che migliora l'aspetto complessivo delle labbra.La texture di questo balsamo-roseto è davvero piacevole. È morbido e cremoso, scivola senza sforzo sulle labbra e le idrata delicatamente. Non ho avuto problemi di secchezza o screpolature dopo averlo applicato, il che lo rende perfetto per l'uso quotidiano. Inoltre, non è appiccicoso e non si accumula nelle pieghe delle labbra.Sono così entusiasta di questo balsamo-roseto che ho già ordinato altri tre. Mi piace averne uno a portata di mano ovunque vada, sia nella borsa che nel cassetto del trucco. È diventato un prodotto indispensabile nella mia routine di bellezza quotidiana.In conclusione, consiglio vivamente il balsamo-roseto per labbra a chiunque cerchi un prodotto di qualità con un bel colore e una texture piacevole. È favoloso, dona alle labbra un aspetto naturale e le idrata efficacemente. Sono così soddisfatto che ho deciso di ordinare altri tre. Non vedo l'ora di continuare a utilizzarlo e godere dei suoi numerosi vantaggi per le mie labbra.","Reviewed in Italy on 10 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1721","Revlon Super Lustrous Glass Shine Lipstick,","EVERYONE said ""Girl, that is YOUR lipstick!""","Blossom","Yep. I bought this lipstick in three shades when it first became available in stores and hoped to never look back. After I changed my copper red hair to a cool mahogany, though, #009 (Toasting Glasses, a dusty rose shade with soft brown undertones to keep the color natural) became the ONLY shade that PERFECTLY complimented my new hair color, pale skin, and green eyes. You know, when you find your perfect jeans, your perfect supportive-but-cute t-shirt bra, and the perfect lipstick how you pray you'll never have to look ever again? That's what this lipstick did for me. Whenever I was in a store that carried it I would always visit the cosmetics aisle and buy up whatever was there. I rarely found more than two tubes, usually finding my shade (and several others) perenially out of stock. The fact that stores often seemed to be ""out"" set off alarm bells (been through this rodeo more times than I could ever count...) but I always had a few nearly used-up backup tubes to get me through till I could buy up more. Thanks to the caprices of cosmetics manufacturers, I knew my search for the next ""okay"" substitute was up the road... again. I'm just so tired of having to go through this ALL THE TIME. Back in the day, great shades of lipsticks stuck around for twenty or thirty years (Revlon's Cherries in the Snow may not be for me but it's been around forever because it's a lot of other women's ""perfect""). Now, every season, cosmetics companies start over, like with fashion, only, cosmetic colors/formulas that work perfectly with a person's skin tone, hair color, eye color, etc. are RARE and don't really ever need changed-out. It's what makes the beauty industry separate from the whims of the apparel industry. When I swung by the cosmetics aisle in a nearby store last week, sadly, a woman stocking the Revlon products was forced to witness my meltdown as I saw my shade was gone. SHE was the one who noticed the entire line of soft-shine buildable lipsticks had been replaced with different colors (and, as I was to quickly learn, a vastly different formula) in an ever-so-slightly different tube. I knew I was making a mistake but I bought two, only to find my soft-shine formula had been replaced with yet another hideous practically-matte formula😡🤬. Neither tube made it into my house. Tried them in the car where both were promptly tossed in the trash. Nope. I HATE matte and it's ugly stepsister, CREAMY🙄/MATTE. I HATE that feeling of defeat, of being forced to waste vast amounts of precious time and money trying to find yet another perfect go-to lipstick, only to wind up with another thirty or forty failed experiments. The stock-woman suggested Amazon and I DID find MY lipstick here. But I know how this story ends. I need to make time (again) to look for a lipstick I'll love as much as this one because what's being sold here is only what's left over, since Revlon has probably ceased production.At any rate, I truly love this lipstick beyond words. This formula is perfect for people who DESPISE both the bone-dry matte/matt-ish lipsticks cosmetics companies WILL NOT STOP PUSHING, or the high-shine, over-the-top, gloppy glosses that scream 1979. The soft shine of THIS formula is just perfect - and the buildable soft-to-intense color (I like the middle ground) is great for those who prefer anything from subtle lip-balm color to a Va-Va-Va-VOOM pout. Finally, I want to say something about the the type of people who seek out this type of lipstick. We LOVE pretty shine and when it comes to these types of formulas we know the pros (see above) and we accept the cons. WE KNOW we will need to apply this lipstick often but we are fine with that because we LOVE the silky texture, the way it looks, and the way it makes us feel. We accept that pressing the lipstick to our lips all the time means that the less of it that's left equals a bit more of a mess. We KNOW that's going to happen but because we love it, we buy it. In a perfect world we could have perfect lipstick to the end. However, we know the looser formulas will never stay solid-till-the-end the way drier formulas can. But skim through the reviews and you'll see that those of us who love a soft shine ACCEPT the cons WITH the pros. If you'll get irritated by a little mess 3/4 of the way into the tube, no shiny lipstick will make you happy. I hope Revlon undrstands that people who love a shiny, buildable lipstick get it. I mean, look at the pictures with some of these reviews. Every shade is (was?) PERFECT for SOMEBODY. If Revlon would continue to sell this product online, some of us would never stop coming back for more. if they never caved to the haters I think a lot of us would have worn our perfect shades to our graves.Meanwhile, my heart is breaking... again because nothing gold can stay 😪","Reviewed in the United States on 18 May 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1802","(Canyon Rose) - Julep It's Balm Lip Balm Crayon","Cherrywood","C Dawn","First time trying these products. I love the burgundy cherrywood color so much. Very nineties. Reminds me of blackberry by Revlon, but now I avoid all of the toxic chemicals. These are a bit cleaner. I would call it more of a moisturizing lipstick than a tinted balm. There is great color payoff. While the color is buildable, if you are looking for a lightly tinted balm, I would skip this, as they might be too intense for you. The color fades slightly after application, presumably from the balm absorbing, but still lasts several hours if you leave it alone. Cherrywood does leave a slight stain, which I also like. I can apply gloss and still look like I have some color to my lips. This is important to me as my lip color is slightly fading with age.Applicator: some reviewers said the applicator is messy, but it’s user error…only if you smear the product all over inside the cap will it then transfer to the outside of the tube. The lid CLICKS when closed, which is brilliant because it stays closed in my purse, so these are awesome for travel. I like that I can retract the product after applying, as some brands only go out further and, if you accidentally extend it too far, you’re in danger of it smushing it in the lid. This was a well thought out feature with this brand.Flavor/scent: there is almost none. I prefer this, because it keeps me from licking my lips once I apply. One reviewer said this shade tastes like cherry; It does not at all. A few other reviewers said it tasted like old lipstick. I can only assume that they got a bad batch, and they should process a return to get a replacement.Upon liking this color so much, I also ordered Cinnamon Raisin, which is a warm-neutral mauve. I’m going to order a few other colors. I wish they made a bright poppy, orange red, since I see they are adding new colors all the time, maybe that’s coming down the pipeline.Hope this review helps!","Reviewed in the United States on 24 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1807","(Canyon Rose) - Julep It's Balm Lip Balm Crayon","Great color, and texture.","Mary","I love this color it’s a beautiful dark wine shade. I’ve been searching for one for forever, that still works with my super pale skin and dark hair without washing me out. Like others have said it’s build-able and hydrating. I found it to have a nice stain to it to, maybe because I chose a dark color. But, even though it requires multiple applications a day to retain the same color there is some color left over after eating/drinking which I liked. The texture is amazingly dewy and smooth, and leaves my lips hydrated. Due to its texture, and light staining I prefer it over my traditional lipsticks in the same colors. My one qualm is the applicator gets a bit dirty on the sides of the plastic tube. Some of the color gets on the cap and rubs the side of the plastic tube, but I just wipe it off after a few uses and it’s good as new. Due to the price and quality of the product I still count this as a win, and will purchase more shades and colors.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1840","(Canyon Rose) - Julep It's Balm Lip Balm Crayon","Hidden gem!","Susisq","This is now become my everyday staple. I purchased the color Canyon Rose. I am Japanese Korean and Irish my skin is neutral Fair. This is really flattering and I get so many compliments. It is a girly pink that goes with almost everything it's not that weird nude that turns yellow. It's all so not too blue of a pink that it looks weird. It makes my lips look more youthful and just pretty. The plus benefit is it is a balm my lips feel smooth but not greasy. Unlike other lip balms the color doesn't dissipate in a few minutes it stays pretty well. This is going to be my go-to lip product. The price of this surprised me for the quality.

"1841","(Canyon Rose) - Julep It's Balm Lip Balm Crayon","Beautiful Color, Well Worth Every $$","Lynn Marie","I purchased ""Julep Beauty It's Balm"" in Canyon Rose 🌹 when looking for a lip stick. This was a happy surprise. This ""lip stick"" is a moisturizing lip color that delivers a natural gloss finish. The color appeared to be the perfect a Rose red onscreen. When I received my lipstick it appeared rather ""purple-ish"" but still within my ""color pallet"". When I applied the Canyon Rose, the color was absolutely 💯 % perfect for me.!!  The lipstick glides on leaving lips feeling soft, drenched with color & glossy. This could raise a ""potential issue"" for some people.  CANYON ROSE has a natural, glossy finish.. This is a non-issue for me, however if you don't care for a glossy finish, choose carefully while looking at the JULEP BEAUTY Lip Colors. There are many colors and finishes to choose from.  I will be purchasing several additional items from Julep Beauty. I highly recommend these products.

"1842","(Canyon Rose) - Julep It's Balm Lip Balm Crayon","Easy to apply, vibrant, lasting color","Crystal S.","On first application, I was amazed. Despite the deep color, it was very easy to apply. Goes on smoothly, and easy to adjust with just a tissue. Wore through a long dinner, and while some color was lost, it didn't wear off completely (and wasn't patchy), so I didn't need to reapply unless I wanted to. So easy and long-lasting I decided to wear during the day, with no regrets. Only downside is a slightly odd smell (not terrible, not great) that eventually went away after 2-3 uses. Ultimately liked this so much, ended up buying in another color, and will buy more.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

This product is excellent as I usually eat my lipstick within 5 min of applying it.Then by chance I found a new wand of the Rimmel Provocalips 16 hour Make your move 730 in a drawer. I don’t know when I bought it or if my daughter gave it to me or how long it’s been there.  I tried it to see if I liked the colour and I did.  The next morning it was still on my lips even after washing my face the night before.  I was amazed.  The sad thing is, I think Rimmel has changed the formula of the Provocalips and I can’t find this particular one anywhere.  I bought the new formula one but it is not the same.  I managed to find the same old formula one at Amazon in a slightly different colour Summer Lovin,  and it is also great.  You can get the old formula from overseas but the postage cost is ridiculous 3 times more than you pay for the product.

"1875","Rimmel London Provocalips 16HR Kiss Proof Lip Colour","Eccezionale, basta saperlo usare al meglio.","ロサリー","I rossetti liquidi in 2 step mi piacciono particolarmente perché uniscono in un solo prodotto le caratteristiche positive di una tinta labbra (a livello di durata) a quelle di un rossetto più idratante.In particolare questo è uno dei migliori che io abbia provato: resiste davvero per tantissime ore (sono arrivata a 11, poi ho dovuto struccarmi) e non teme cibi oleosi, per cui consente, una volta applicato, di vivere l'intera giornata/serata senza preoccupazioni, sbavature o ritocchi.Certo è che queste tinte vanno sapute utilizzare al meglio, per mia esperienza posso dirvi:- applicatele su labbra asciutte, precedentemente idratate e perfettamente pulite (al massimo utilizzate una base studiata appositamente per labbra)- fate una prima passata e lasciatela asciugare bene senza strofinare le labbra tra loro- fate un'eventuale seconda passata se volete un colore più intenso- una volta asciutta la base colore mettete un leggero strato del gloss idratante, sempre evitando di chiudere le labbra, sfregandole.Il gioco è fatto, lo strato di gloss proteggerà il rossetto dall'attacco di sostanze grasse, che tenderebbero a farlo sciogliere, motivo per cui durante la giornata potrete rinnovarlo al bisogno, ma nel mio caso, anche senza questo accorgimento, il colore è durato davvero un'infinità, iniziando solo minimamente ad affievolirsi a partire dal centro delle labbra.Struccare queste tinte in realtà non è difficile, a patto che utilizziate un prodotto bifasico o comunque a base oleosa (se non li avete vanno più che bene del comune olio di cocco, olio di oliva & co.).Last but not least... ottime performance a un ottimo prezzo!(Il prodotto arriva con sigillo trasparente adesivo su ambedue i lati del flacone.

En esta línea de nudes, recomiendo también el tono 730 Make your move (tira más a ""carne"", más bien cálido y ligeramente más oscurito).De duración en mi caso igual que otros fijos que tengo como los Matte Ink o los Macarons de L'Oreal. Destaco en éstos que se queda una textura muy ligera y al final se me acaba yendo un poco por la mucosa al comer y con el paso de unas cuantas horas (pero esto me pasa con todos, no lo considero un defecto en sí del producto). Un retoquito y ya está, pero en este caso, al fundirse bastante con el color de mi labio, ni siquiera es que haga mucha falta (si fuera un color más fuerte, quizás sí).Entre la capa de color y el brillo/fijador hay que apenas esperar, se seca rápido. Al principio no se queda mate del todopero con el paso del tiempo sí (de todas formas, para mí no es ningún problema, tampoco es que quede super glossy ni nada por el estilo, apenas brillosito). Lo único negativo que le encuentro es que el brillo empieza a escasear cuando aún no se ha acabado el color (me ha pasado con otros, es que realmente trae menos producto y es más denso, por lo cual cunde menos). También es menor cantidad de producto que otros fijos en general. Pero por el precio al que aquí se consiguen y el resultado del producto, valen totalmente la pena. Un producto muy recomendable en general.","Reviewed in the Netherlands on 30 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Può essere usata da sola e già così ha un bellissimo effetto. Se vi piace, passate l'altro scovolino, che è il fissativo che dà un finish lucido.Il rossetto si asciuga molto presto, tanto che lo scovolino lucido, passato dopo, è rimasto pulito!Non si toglie facilmente (anche dopo essermi struccata mi sembrava ci fosse della pigmentazione sulle labbra), quindi è durevole.Ho messo varie foto per farvi vedere l'effetto dei vari colori e della loro durata.1) Flirty Fling con lucido2) Flirty Fling senza lucido, solo matte3) Flirty Fling, c'è ancora pigmentazione dopo una giornata in cui ho mangiato e bevuto normalmente.4) Kiss me you fool, versione matte5) Fire Creacker, versione matteDalla foto si vede l'effetto morbido, non avvertivo l'effetto ""tirante"" che molte volte danno le tinte labbra.Consiglio di aspettare che la parte colorata si sia asciugata prima di stendere il lucido, in questo modo lo scovolino bianco resta sempre completamente pulito.Personalmente preferisco la versione matte senza lucido, mi piacciono più le tinte opache sulle labbra, ma ovviamente è questione di gusti!Arriva sigillato e anche questo mi ha fatto piacere, i trucchi senza sigillo sono antigienici e li rimando immediatamente indietro.Consigliatissimo, uno dei migliori (se non il migliore) rossetto no transfer mai provati, anche i colori più sgargianti donano un bell'effetto, prezzo assolutamente competitivo e tenuta performante.","Reviewed in Australia on 15 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I still like it, even though it's not a typical look for me. The best thing about this lip color is that I can eat an entire meal without it rubbing off. That's a rare lipstick! It does require a little extra effort to remove at the end of a day. Application feels nice; it's slick and glides on smoothly. It's instantly opaque with a shimmery metallic finish.

"1917","NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP Soft Matte Metallic Lip Cream","If you're a Budapest fan...","Starfleet Dropout","Nyx's Budapest is my favorite shade of lipstick (Budapest original is shown in my selfie). I was excited to find the same shade with this metallic matte finish (love the modern yet natural look of matte! 😊). I applied it, let it dry, looked at it, it looked off and the color wasn't as flattering as usual. The metallic Budapest is a fairly different shade, when put side-by-side, than the original Budapest matte finish. The original Budapest is more of a mulberry color (like a rosey mauve color), the metallic Budapest is way more coppery orange, like a rosey pumpkin shade. I love Nyx lip products, they're flattering colors with great coverage, you can't feel that you're wearing their lip products, never sticky or hot, great quality products for a low price so it delivered in that sense. But I had to take away a star for the color not being like the original. I would understand putting a gold metallic in the shade so it would look ""metallic"" but it's too orange and throws off the whole color. If you didn't buy Budapest you'll probably be happy with your purchase though, still great lip color! 🤷‍♀️","Reviewed in the United States on 16 May 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It has decent staying power and won't transfer too much. The shade is ultra nice, I had a similar one from Maybelline a few years ago but it smelled industrial and came off very easily. The packaging is very neatly done, probably the nicest lipstick packaging I've seen. I had previously bought the shade 437 and I've been equally happy with that one as well.

I haven’t tried the other one yet so can’t speak on it yet.It can get a bit clumpy especially obvious on the darker color so use a light coating and build from there if needed.As with most matte liquids on is with very fair skin, if you get it on your skin it can stain pretty fast so be very careful. Use a liner to help avoid this if you want. It helps but isn’t mandatory.

"2115","Rimmel Stay Matte Lip Liquid, Pink Blink, 0.21 Fluid Ounce","Lipstick is worth the $$$ product not safety sealed","jim","I’ve bought a two shades now from this seller; currently trying the Vanilla Lovin’ shade. The shade itself was exactly what I was going for but the formula is kind of splotchy so with this colour and most of the nudes you have to apply 2-3 coats for it to look even and matte. But once on it stays on even when eating and drinking for at least four hours with minimal budge and reapplication. One thing that bothers me is that these tubes don’t come sealed with stickers so literally they could be returns or could have been opened and tested but you would ever know Because there’s no security seal anywhere which is disconcerting for a beauty product. Now that I know this is normal for this shop I’ll buy this line from my local drug store, where at least the tubes are safe sealed (particularly during a pandemic).","Reviewed in Canada on 12 March 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2140","Rimmel Stay Matte Lip Liquid, Pink Blink, 0.21 Fluid Ounce","Long lasting!","Crystal","First time ever buying/using Rimmel. This acts more like a lip stain. Perfect for me as I don’t like lipsticks that transfer easily and need to be touched up often or end up with some on front teeth. Goes on wet but dries almost immediately so caution to get right amount where needed. I use “chapstick” to get a bit of a gloss finish to change the appearance a bit. Most of the time I just apply a small amount and gently go over lips for a more subtle look. Lasts quite a long time which is ideal for me. Anxious to try other colours as this can be put on super light for less vibrant colour or heavier for darker shade. Makes it a fairly handy way to save room in purse, makeup case. I bought a few different colours to use as I really like this. Also, not heavy with perfume/scent.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The color is very vibrant but the color doesn't match my skin and that was my own mistake.When you apply the matte lipstick, a little goes a long way. I suggest you pat a little on your lips and then spread it. Then add a little more to the areas you missed because the color is so vibrant and smooth, that it is like putting on chapstick.The moisture of the matte lipstick is unbelievable! It doesn't dry out your lips or cake up. It's feels as if you aren't wearing any lipstick because of how light it is.The longevity lasts you a very long time.My only concern was how the item didn't come with an enclosed wrap.Besides that this is worth your money!Just be careful of the color you choose.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 August 2022","4.2 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

And it's obviously not transfer proof, but it's definitely not sticky or tacky at all.I obviously highly recommend the product and shade. I don't even wear makeup on a daily basis and never go through a product before it's become old and crusty. And yet this is a product I've gotten to the bottom of twice! I'd call that a win for sure.

The packaging is pink and red with shiny cherries on it. I took the tube out of the package, which was also gorgeous, and opened it up to swatch it. This is where things took a turn for the worse -- the gloss wasn't nearly as shiny as I'd expected it to be. The smell also kicked in, and that's when I felt the first inkling of disappointment. It smells like a cross between cherry soda and a port-a-potty! Although the smell could be interpreted in many ways, it will take some getting used to for me.

"2218","Lime Crime Wet Cherry Lip Gloss (SWEET CHERRY)","Worth the purchase IMO, Pros v. Cons in the Description","Stella","I ordered the ""Juicy Cherry"", it's a light sparkly pink. It arrived quickly without damages (which is rare for amazon). On to the list-Pros: It's cruelty free and much more affordable than what I'd usually buy from sephora for an equally good product. It's cute and it smells good (like an artificial candy like cherry smell). It has a thick consistency with just a slight tackiness; it's not too sticky. Once it sets/dries, it's consistency improves. It's got shimmer with slight sparkle. The pink is like a warm baby pink, really enhances the color of your lips. Slim and cute packaging.Cons:It does transfer and it's staying power is moderate unless you eat or drink, like most lip products unfortunately.I have never been a fan of lip gloss because I'm sensitive to textures and consistencies. I decided to try something new and I'm glad I did. I really enjoy this product.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 July 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It also kind of tastes like kids makeup mixed with cough syrup, but once again it isn't too flavorful so that doesn't matter.I don't really feel like it's worth 18$, it kind of feels like kids makeup.

The texture is like a gel that is soft and cushy.  I find it has great adherence and color payoff. The only somewhat negative for me is the flavor a bit like cough syrup (cherry flavor is a fine line) but it doesn't prevent me from reaching for this product above even my YSL and Chanel beloved lip products.

"2261","Honest Lip Crayon Lush Sheer - Rose Women Lipstick","Definitely Sheer and Shiny.","V.L.","First, I'd like to point out that these are supposed to be sheer (hence... the product name). I'm seeing some low ratings that the colors are too subtle. If your are expecting an opaque color, these are definitely not for you and you should spend your money on different lipsticks. These are kinda like Chapsticks with a tiny bit of color. Also, everyone will look different depending on your natural lip color. I have dark lips so most colors won't pop on mine but will probably show more on pale lips.Second, some other low ratings are because the colors didn't last at all. These aren't supposed to last. They're just lip balms pretty much. Though I have to admit that I wished the moisturizing effects lasted longer.With this said, these lip crayons are suppose to slightly enhance your natural lip color while giving a shine. Also smells good!There are hardly any swatch pictures online and on the website so I'm posting my own for your reference. I also took pictures (with flash) of the lip crayons on my bottom lip and naked top lips for comparison.My lips are slightly dark and naturally mauve with some deep pink undertones. So when I wear these...- Sherbert gives be a pink tint. (Without flash, the pink is noticeable)- Petal gives me a coral tint.- Chestnut is totally colorless and useless on my lips so I might return this. (I've seen a picture on someone else's pale lips and it really gives her a pretty nude brown/chestnut color).- Rose is a beautiful deep red color. (The flash accentuated the rose/pink but it's more like a deep red rose color.)My lips are dry and these don't accentuate my dry lips too bad. I'm also allergic to some ingredients (I don't know which ones irritate me) and these haven't flared or gave me blisters on my lips yet.If you're looking for a moisturizing lip product, with a sheer tint, you might want to try these. They're affordable and ingredients are less ""toxic"" (no parabens, no petrolatum, etc).These are definitely perfect for someone with pale lips. For those with darker lips, you will need to be more thoughtful about your color choices because the lighter colors will probably won't show very much.Too bad they don't last a long time but it's worth trying.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 April 2019","4.1 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My 3 year old got a hold of it and it wasn't salvageable, so I ordered the replacement. What was delivered came in a box marked Sheer Rose, exactly what I ordered. Inside the box, however, was Coral. Not at all flattering on my skintone and not worth the cost of return shipping for a refund. I was planning on wearing it to an event this weekend, but I'll have to make due with something else.

‘Back row smooch’ has been my staple lipgloss since high school. I never tried the others. I guess if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. It’s literally the most natural tinted lipgloss it matches my natural lip color too (just a hotter pink) and goes with everything. (Make sure you apply to clean lips, some pics I have some foundation residue on my lips from doing my makeup which gives it a slight orange tint for me but I didn’t mind it)  It has some blue speckles in it which you won’t notice unless you’re looking up close which is perfect for me. It stays pretty glossy but tbh not for too long. Maybe an hour of glossy goodness ♥️","Reviewed in the United States on 4 July 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2354","Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Diamond Lip Plumper Gloss","Ultra-Hydrating Hybrid Gloss Plumper","Dominique Le Blu","I am beyond thrilled to have finally found this lip gloss after searching for it tirelessly. I used to purchase this product years ago in stores, but it seemingly disappeared from the shelves. However, thanks to my decision to check on Amazon, I stumbled upon it again, and it has quickly reclaimed its position as my favorite lip plumping gloss.One of the standout features of this gloss is its ultra-hydrating formula. It effortlessly glides onto my lips, providing a boost of moisture that leaves them feeling soft, supple, and nourished. Unlike other glosses that can leave my lips feeling dry and chapped, this product helps my lips appear smoother and more luscious.I especially appreciate the lip plumping effect that this gloss offers. While the tingling sensation may be off-putting for some, I personally find it invigorating and worth the slight tingle. The plumping effect isn't overwhelming or uncomfortable; instead, it provides a subtle enhancement to my lips, making them appear fuller and more defined.Another aspect that makes this lip gloss even more appealing is its vegan formulation. As someone who values ethical and cruelty-free products, I am delighted to know that this gloss aligns with my values. Its vegan ingredients offer peace of mind, allowing me to enjoy the product without compromising my principles.In terms of performance, this gloss ticks all the boxes. It delivers on its promises of hydration, smoothness, and plumping, leaving my lips looking and feeling fabulous. It also boasts impressive staying power, maintaining its shine and color throughout the day, reducing the need for constant reapplication.In conclusion, this Ultra-Hydrating Hybrid Gloss Plumper has made a triumphant return into my beauty routine, and I couldn't be happier. Its ability to provide both hydration and plumping effects sets it apart from other lip glosses I've tried in the past. The tingling sensation is surprisingly enjoyable, and its vegan formulation aligns with my values. If you're seeking a lip gloss that nourishes, enhances, and leaves your lips looking luscious, this is the perfect product for you. Don't hesitate to give it a try and experience its magic for yourself.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2369","Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Diamond Lip Plumper Gloss","New go to... 🤍🤍🤍","Chelsea Allison","I don't see a massive plumping effect but it is there, enough so that this is my new favorite lip PRODUCT overall. It seems to soak into my lips overtime and actually hydrate them, rather than sit on top and have no benefit besides looks. This means you obviously have to reapply it but you do with any gloss. It has a pleasant smell, I would say just a cosmetics smell. Leaves no gross taste in your mouth. I would say that to me, it almost feels more cooling than tinglingly. So if you're looking for a plumper that burns, this isn't it. But I recently had an allergic reaction to the too face lip injection plumper, I think it's called, so I found this and prefer it so much more. The too faced product left a dark red line of inflammation/irritation around the outside of my lips even after removing the product. I almost gave up on plumpers all together because of that but I'm so glad I decided to try this. I want other colors now. 10/10 would recommend as a gloss hybrid balm that's very comfortable & flattering. 5/10 recommend if you're looking for significant plumping.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2407","Kosas Wet Lip Oil Gloss | Juicy, Plumping Treatment","My experience for using it for a day & 1/2","Julie M. Harrison","Got Unbuttoned because the color looks gorgeous when Glamzilla used it. When I first used it I loved it. Just 1 swipe with small amounts, my lips are already glossy & hydrated. If more than that my lips will look too oily.I was satisfied with color at first, but when I really started using it today, I got mixed feelings. One, it fits the description of being glossy & sheer. Two, just an hour or 2 without messing with it, the color became less noticeable & started to become my lip color. I'm not sure if it's because of the lighting or the lip oil got accustomed to my body temperature or something, my lip color looks like a slightly nicer pale pink; my original lip color is pale ash grey nude-pink. I don't really hate it, but when I started to add a bit more, the tint isn't as noticeable. The tint is a bit too sheer for my taste.However, I'm still going to use it because 1) it's pricey, 2) it works since my lips don't look dry or feel super dry (the dry winter weather is killing my lips). Lastly, I think that it works pretty well as a lip gloss or as a base for your lip stick. After putting on the lip oil, I dab a small amount of matte lip product using my finger, & it looks amazing. So far 30 or so minutes in, my lips aren't feeling dry at all!Overall, it's still a very good lip oil, but the color you see on the models is slightly incorrect, since the tint is about 1 or 2 shades lighter. Or it looks like that because they wore concealer before putting on the lip oil, I'm not sure.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 February 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2413","Kosas Wet Lip Oil Gloss | Juicy, Plumping Treatment","Not worth the price, misleading about plumping","Dylan","I am pretty sure the only way that this product claims to plump lips once you really read the box is through peptides and hydration which is nourishment, but don't think you're getting anything near Too Faced Lip Injection or their copy cats. I ordered this shade, unbuttoned, and Dip, and I found both to be too brown and underwhelming on me. I have pale olive skin for reference, and I was personally hoping the pink undertones would come through more. I am thinking about trying Malibu, which looks too pink for me in the photo, but based on how much more muted these were in person it might work.Beside the color and lack of plumping, its not a bad lipgloss, but for the price its not worth it. I am a fan of other Kosas products, and if you are in to their mission statement then go ahead, but this isn't their holy grail item. It reminds me of Mary Kay lipglosses from the 2000s in texture and the high shimmer and gloss. I think this product could be compared to Dior Lip oil, in the sense that they are both decent products, and both marketed to a certain audience (guilty of both!) and sell it overpriced costs.TLDR; if it makes you happy, buy it.

"2494","L'OREAL PARIS Infallible 2Step Lipstick, Relentless Rouge","Bin absolut begeistert","Angelika","Das ist nach sehr vielen Experimenten für mich der perfekte ""your lips but better"" Lippenstift. Ein sehr dezenter und natürlicher Farbton der aber trotzdem nicht langweilig ist, ich empfinde ihn eher als elegant und ich habe bisher noch nie Komplimente bekommen wenn ich Lippenstift getragen habe, bei diesem hier jedoch schon mehrmals. Man muss allerdings sagen dass ich einen sehr hellen Hautton habe. Meine Mutter, schon über 60 und mit nur minimal dunklerem Ton als ich, sah mit diesem Ton eher ""ausgewaschen"" und fahl aus. Ich würde also auf jeden Fall empfehlen, nach Fotos der Farbe online zu suchen. Es gibt auch ein Video zu den Lippenstiftfarben von  L'Oréal auf Youtube.Die Haltbarkeit ist sehr gut, wenn leider auch nicht so lange wie bei den dunkleren, kräftiger pigmentierten Farben. Das ist andererseits nicht so tragisch weil es anders als bei den anderen Farben auch nicht 100% offensichtlich ist wenn die Farbe nicht mehr perfekt sitzt was auch sehr praktisch ist.Ich empfinde den Stift nicht als übermäßig austrocknend. er ist sicher weniger pflegend als normale Lippenstift aber bei weitem besser als lang haltende Stifte der älteren Generation. Den Pflegebalsam verwende ich meistens gar nicht weil damit die Haltbarkeit wie es mir scheint reduziert wird.Ich mag auch die Maybelline Superstay Lippenstife sehr gerne, die fühlen sich von der Konsistenz her etwas leichter an auf den Lippen als die L'Oréal Indefectible Stifte. Ich habe auch die beiden hellen Farben (Quartz Start und Delicious Pink) von Maybelline aber das sind einfach nur helle, ein bisschen langweilige Farben - bei weitem nicht so perfekt wie diese hier.Ich hoffe,  L'Oréal stellt diese Farbe niemals ein denn das ist der allererste Lippenstift den ich mir immer und immer wieder kaufen werde.","Reviewed in Germany on 2 July 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Da un tono aterciopelado.Tiene una barra de brillo, que si lo aplicas sobre este, cuando se ha secado, le da un tono hidratante. Esto es por si no te gusta el tono mate, puedes usarlo mate o brillo.Es un color natural apto para el día a día.✅ El color es muy bonito, es un tono precioso.✅ No se cuartea ni se agrieta✅ Dura horas y horas, puedes comer, beber, nadar, lo que quieras, que no se borra.✅ Queda hidratado✅ tono brillante✅ tono mateMUY IMPORTANTE APLICACIÓN:No aplicar en exceso, mojas el pincel pero que quede lo justo, y lo aplicas por el labio. Yo me aplico la parte de abajo y junto los labios y se pinta todo, y si queda algo sin perfilar, le das un toque. Pero es muy importante no poner en exceso, porque sino sí que se agrieta. Si te aplicas poco, queda una capa fina y adecuada. Tarda unos segundos en secarse, así que ten cuidado de no mancharte ahí.COMO QUITARLO:Si quieres quitarlo hay que quitarlo con una toallita desmaquillante y un desmaquillador en crema. Yo he probado con agua , con agua micelar, y tónico de limpieza , agua y jabón, y no se limpia. Solo con desmaquillante en crema.No deja rojeces ni irrita los labios, al menos en mi caso, que si me ocurre con otros pintalabios baratos.","Reviewed in Spain on 13 December 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
